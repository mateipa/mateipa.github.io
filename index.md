**Welcome!**

My name is **Mario Teixeira Parente**.
This website contains some contents of my academic life.

From 10/2016-09/2020, I was a PhD student at the [Chair for Numerical Mathematics](https://www-m2.ma.tum.de/bin/view/Allgemeines/WebHomeEN) (M2) in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.ma.tum.de/en) of the [Technical University Munich](https://www.tum.de/en) (TUM).
My research focus lied on **Uncertainty Quantification** (UQ), a field from applied mathematics using tools from statistics, probability theory, and numerics.

Currently, I am a postdoc in the Data-Driven Discovery (DDD) Group of the [JÃ¼lich Centre for Neutron Science](https://www.fz-juelich.de/jcns/EN/Home/home_node.html) (JCNS) outstation within the [Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum](https://mlz-garching.de/englisch.html) (MLZ) at the neutron source [FRM II](http://www.frm2.tum.de/en/) in Garching near Munich.
The focus of my work is the investigation of **machine learning methods** for neutron scattering data.

At the moment, I am also a lecturer at the [Department of Computer Science and Mathematics](https://www.cs.hm.edu/en/home/index.en.html) of the [Munich University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hm.edu/en/index.en.html) (HM).
I offer a course on the **fundamentals of UQ** for advanced bachelor students and a freshmen course on **linear algebra**.
