**Welcome!**

My name is **Mario Teixeira Parente**.
This website contains some contents of my academic life.

I am an [interim professor](https://www.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/personen/mitarbeitende/teixeira_parente/index.html) at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.en.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) at [Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München](https://www.lmu.de/en/index.html).
In this context, I am teaching a Bachelor's course on _Advanced Mathematical Methods in Statistics_ and a Master's course on [_Optimization for Machine Learning_](https://slds-lmu.github.io/website_optimization/).

For more details on my professional path, please see my [CV](/cv.md).
