**Welcome!**

My name is **Mario Teixeira Parente**.

This website contains some contents of my academic life.

From 10/2016-09/2020, I was a PhD student at the [Chair for Numerical Mathematics](https://www-m2.ma.tum.de) (M2) in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.ma.tum.de) of the [Technical University Munich](https://www.tum.de/en) (TUM).
My research focus lied in **Uncertainty Quantification (UQ)**, a field from applied mathematics using tools from **statistics**, **probability theory**, and **numerics**. Applications are possible wherever models are involved, be it in engineering disciplines as hydrology, in the social sciences, or physics.

Currently, I am a postdoc in the Data-Driven Discovery Group of the [JÃ¼lich Centre for Neutron Science](https://www.fz-juelich.de/jcns/EN/Home/home_node.html) outstation at the [FRM II](http://www.frm2.tum.de/en/) in Garching near Munich.
The focus of my work is the investigation of **machine learning methods** for neutron scattering data.
