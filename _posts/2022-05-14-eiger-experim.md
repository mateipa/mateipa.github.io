On the weekend of May 7/8, me and my colleagues from [JCNS](https://www.fz-juelich.de/jcns) at [MLZ](https://mlz-garching.de) were given beamtime at the thermal three-axes spectrometer [EIGER](https://www.psi.ch/en/sinq/eiger) at the spallation source [SINQ](https://www.psi.ch/en/sinq) from [PSI](https://www.psi.ch/en) (Paul Scherrer Institute) in Villigen, Switzerland.

It was the first time that we had the opportunity to run our approach [ARIANE](https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/ainx/ariane) (**AR**tificial **I**ntelligence-**A**ssisted **N**eutron **E**xperiments) for an AI-assisted TAS ([three-axes spectrometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_triple-axis_spectrometry)) experiment after over 1.5 years of development.
Our general aim was to reproduce results from [Li *et al.*, 2014](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.175501) (Fig. 1b) and investigate some of our approach's properties.

Since the results will be part of an upcoming submission at a peer-reviewed journal, we cannot discuss them here unfortunately.
However, there will be another stay at EIGER for two days in July in order to run our approach with different settings and complete our studies.
I am really looking forward to this trip, not only because it is another opportunity to test our approach, but also since I enjoyed the natural and professional environment there.

For now, I would really like to thank the responsibles of SINQ and EIGER for their support.
