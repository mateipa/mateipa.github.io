I am very delighted to announce that our paper [*Active learning-assisted neutron spectroscopy with log-Gaussian processes*]({% link _posts/2023-04-21-ariane-pub.md %}) has won the [Helmholtz AI](https://www.helmholtz.ai) Award "Best Paper 2023".
My co-authors and I are very happy to receive this award, as it is a great recognition of our dedicated work over three years.

The award ceremony took place online on December 13, 2023 as part of the Helmholtz AI annual retrospective.
In addition to our award, two other projects were awarded "Best Digital Resource 2023" and "Best PhD Dissertation 2023".
For our project, I briefly presented our work behind the paper and addressed a few words of thanks to everyone who made this scientific journey possible.
