From March 20-23, the [ECNS 2023](https://ecns2023.eu/) (_European Conference on Neutron Scattering_) was being held at the [Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum](https://www.mlz-garching.de/) (MLZ) in Garching.
It was very nice to see some familiar faces again and to exchange with them on exciting topics.
The venue on the TUM campus was really well organized and I think all of the participants felt comfortable there.

The topic of [my talk](https://indico.frm2.tum.de/event/263/contributions/3765/) on March 22 was the [recent results]({% link _posts/2023-01-20-ariane-rev.md %}) on our active learning-based approach to assist neutron spectroscopy experiments.
It was the first time that I presented in front of an audience consisting mainly of experts in neutron spectroscopy.
The questions to our approach and its results were critical but well-formulated such that we were having controverse and fruitful discussions on our approach after the talk for quite some time.

I would like to thank the organizers very much for their effort and success in planning and conducting such a great event.
