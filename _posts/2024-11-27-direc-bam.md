A couple of days ago, the faculty council of the [HSPF School of Engineering](https://engineeringpf.hs-pforzheim.de/en/) accepted me as the new program director of our bachelor program [Applied Mathematics (B.Sc.)](https://engineeringpf.hs-pforzheim.de/bachelor/informationstechnik/angewandte_mathematik) retrospectively as of October 1, 2024.

My colleagues approached me whether I would like to take this responsibility, although I am quite new to the school.
I, more or less, immediately answered positively since it is a nice opportunity for me to bring in my ideas to this program.
Actually, I really enjoy thinking about what a good program in Applied Mathematics looks like.
It is also interesting for me to see what bureaucratic and other issues arise in the design of study programs in general.

I am very happy that my colleagues trust that my contributions can have a positive impact on the program and its students.
Indeed, we still have lot of work to do on the program, and I hope that the efforts will bear fruit with well-trained applied mathematicians.
