I feel honoured to announce that I became a "Mentor" in the [Max Weber Program of the State of Bavaria](https://www.elitenetzwerk.bayern.de/en/home/funding-programs/max-weber-program) (Max Weber-Programm Bayern, MWP) which is giving scholarships with financial and ideal support to promising students.
During my time as a student, I was lucky to be part of this program too and have benefited a lot from its offers.

Now, as an alumnus, I have the honour and responsibility to support current scholarship holders in my own mentoring group which mainly consists of computer science and mathematics students from universities in Munich.
The idea of the mentoring format is that the mentor stays in touch with the whole group (together or individually) on a regular basis such that everybody gets the chance to exchange experiences or discuss general topics from the academic life.

I am looking forward to meetings with the students and hope to be a supportive part for their studies, but also feel that they will certainly be a source of inspiration for me.
