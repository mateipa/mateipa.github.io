Our first experiment at the three-axes spectrometer [EIGER](https://www.psi.ch/en/sinq/eiger) was mentioned in a [previous post]({% link _posts/2022-05-14-eiger-experim.md %}).
From July 24 to 28, we have now come back to [SINQ](https://www.psi.ch/en/sinq)/[PSI](https://www.psi.ch/en) in Villigen (Switzerland) and performed a second part of experimental studies with [ARIANE](https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/ainx/ariane), our approach for AI-assisted TAS experiments.
We tested several different settings for this approach and studied properties related to its robustness w.r.t. changes in its parameters.
Indeed, for each computational approach, it is important to learn the sensitivities of its results caused by varying its inputs.

The results are included in a manuscript which will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal soon.

I would like to thank the responsibles of SINQ and EIGER again for providing beam time at their research facility and for their support during our two stays.
