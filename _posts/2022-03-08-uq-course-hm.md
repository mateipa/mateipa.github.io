During the coming summer, I will give again lectures on [_Fundamentals of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ)_](https://zpa.cs.hm.edu/public/module/374/) in a course for Bachelor students at the [Department of Computer Science and Mathematics](https://www.cs.hm.edu/) (FK07) of the [University of Applied Sciences Munich](https://www.hm.edu/) (HM).

The motivations and contents behind this course can be found in a [post from last year]({% link _posts/2021-04-01-uq-course-hm.md %}).

I am looking forward to give these lectures again and meet new interested students!
