From October 11-14, the [JCNS Workshop 2022](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/jcns/expertise/conferences-and-workshops/jcns-workshops/jcns-workshop2022) was being held at the beautiful _Evangelische Akademie Tutzing_ close to the lake of Starnberg.
The general topic of the workshop was _Trends and Perspectives in Neutron Scattering: Experiments and data analysis in the digital age_.

Thankfully, I got invited as a speaker and had the opportunity to present our [latest findings]({% link _posts/2022-09-05-ariane-prepr.md %}) in a talk entitled _AI-assisted neutron spectroscopy -- Log-Gaussian processes for TAS_.
The questions and discussions after my talk were really pleasant and the feedback that I received during the whole week was great, constructive, and inspiring.
With this momentum, I started right away to extend the comparison of our approach by including [gpCAM](https://gpcam.lbl.gov/), another approach for autonomous neutron and X-ray experiments.
Anyone who is interested in the results of this comparison is welcome to contact me for an informal presentation and conversation.

I would like to thank the organizers for their invitation and the organization of this great workshop at this beautiful place.
