From April 20--22, 2021, I had the possibility to be part of a virtual workshop on _Autonomous Discovery in Science and Engineering_ ([website](https://autonomous-discovery.lbl.gov/)) organized by the _Center for Advanced Mathematics for Energy Research Applications_ ([CAMERA](https://www.camera.lbl.gov/)) at _Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory_ ([LBNL](https://www.lbl.gov/)).

I gave a talk on _Autonomous Experiments for Neutron Three-Axis Spectrometers (TAS) with Log-Gaussian Processes_ in the breakout session on _Autonomous Discovery in Neutron Scattering_.
The presentation covered recent methodological advances of our group in the application of log-Gaussian processes for autonomous neutron scattering experiments.

Other talks were either focussing on physical applications or were showing methodological approaches to autonomous material discovery.
Although I was not able to fully follow the physics parts, I got a decent impression of what the problems are that groups try to solve in this area.
