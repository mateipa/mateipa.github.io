During the winter term 2023/24, I will be an [interim professor](https://www.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/personen/mitarbeitende/teixeira_parente/index.html) (Professorship for Computational Statistics and Data Science) at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.en.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) at [Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München](https://www.lmu.de/en/index.html).
I am substituting Prof. [Thomas Nagler](https://www.tnagler.com) and will give lectures on _Advanced Mathematical Methods in Statistics_ (Bachelor) and [_Optimization in Machine Learning_](https://slds-lmu.github.io/website_optimization/) (Master).

I am truly grateful and excited for this opportunity since I really enjoy teaching, but also because I can gain valuable experience with the responsibilities of a professor.
