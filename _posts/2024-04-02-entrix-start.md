I am delighted to announce that I am starting at [Entrix](https://www.entrixenergy.com/) as a Senior Data Scientist from today.

My work will focus on **optimization** and **time series analysis**.
In both directions, there are very interesting questions that we want to answer.

- **Optimization:** Based on predictions of energy prices, what are the optimum times for charging/discharging battery energy storage systems?
- **Time series analysis:** How can we predict future energy prices based on their history?

I am really looking forward to address these questions and work with the people at Entrix!
