In May, I was invited to be part of a panel discussion at the [20 years celebration]({% link _posts/2024-05-04-enb-20years.md %}) of the Elite Network of Bavaria.
Now, a [profile of my person](https://www.elitenetzwerk.bayern.de/en/home/active-network/profiles-of-our-members), in the form of an interview, was published on the website of Elite Network of Bavaria as part of a collection of other profiles.

I want to thank the responsibles for inviting me to the interview and for creating this successful profile.
Institutions and their responsibles putting that much effort into creating a profile of my person is extraordinary for me and fills me with great gratitude.

**Note:** My profile will be available on the website for approximately one year.
After that, it  will be removed and replaced by profiles of other members to provide some variety.
